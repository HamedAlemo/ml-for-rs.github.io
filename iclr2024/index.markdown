# Machine Learning for Remote Sensing

This workshop promotes trans-disciplinary research through diverse view-points to tackle the pressing questions of our times, such as climate change, social inequalities, biodiversity, and food security. 
Developing modern machine learning approaches tailored towards remote sensing data is key to investigating these problems efficiently. This second Machine Learning for Remote Sensing (ML4RS) workshop promotes this exchange by allowing researchers to present their research on environmentally and societally important applications and/or  innovative methods that can have an impact in such application domains. 

Outcomes from the first ML4RS workshop at ICLR 2023 in Kigali Rwanda can be found [here](https://nasaharvest.github.io/ml-for-remote-sensing/iclr2023/)

### Paper Format

We invite short papers describing new and ongoing/in progress research of **4 pages**. Page limits do not include references, which are unlimited. Papers will be **non-archival**. To prepare your submission, please use the [LaTeX style files for the ML4RS workshop ICLR 2024](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rmryxjvrkhyj#f5b22c). Paper reviews will be **double blind**. When submitting your manuscript, make sure you do not include any personally-identifying information such as author names or GitHub links which would de-anonymize the submission.

Machine Learning for Remote Sensing is non-archival and thus dual submission is allowed where permitted by third parties.

### Poster Format

Please submit poster following the [ICLR (Workshop) Portrait posters format](https://iclr.cc/FAQ/PosterInformation) in Portrait. Posters will hung on the wall using painters tape (that will be provided). The dimensions should not exceed not to exceed H 91 x W 610 cm / H 36 x W 24 in.

<!--
### Paper Submission

Please submit your paper before the deadline (see important dates!) via CMT on the following submission site:

- **Submission site:** [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4RS2024](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ML4RS2024)

You can still edit your submission until the deadline. You can also choose to submit a supplementary pdf alongside the 4-page paper. However, the reviewers are not required to look at the supplementary files.
